# Arduino-Robot-Car
This project is an Arduino-based robot car controlled via Bluetooth using the HC-05 module. The robot can move in four directions: forward, backward, right, and left, all controlled remotely via a Bluetooth connection. The car is controlled using mobile apps like "Arduino Bluetooth Controller" and "Arduino Car".
